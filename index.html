        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          So who am I? I'm a 22-year-old IT student hailing from Finland,
          currently on my second year of Information Technology studies at the
          University of Turku. Basically I'm a third year student. Having
          wrapped up my Bachelor's thesis, I'm expecting to get my Bachelor's
          degree in the summer of 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fascination with computers and technology dates back to my
          childhood, and I've nurtured programming as a hobby for several years.
          Both in my free time and throughout my academic journey, I've had the
          opportunity to delve into a diverse array of technologies and
          concepts. I have worked with languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript,
          Python, Java, C, and C++, my expertise predominantly lies within the
          JavaScript ecosystem, where I've honed my skills with TypeScript,
          NodeJs, ReactJs, and NextJs. Recently I have also expanded my
          knowledge in the Java world with Spring Boot. And I am aiming to
          expand my knowledge further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my knowledge stems from my university studies and personal
          projects during my free time. My university studies have provided me
          with a robust foundation in IT and software development. In addition
          to my formal education, I successfully completed the Fullstack Open
          program, where I gained extensive insights into full-stack development
          and application development in general.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I've successfully undertaken a couple of independent learning projects
          and am actively engaged in a few more. In addition to these larger
          endeavors, I've tackled several mini and learning projects as integral
          components of my university studies, broadening my skill set along the
          way. Most of my projects are crafted within the NodeJs environment,
          reflecting my proficiency in this ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I'm eager to diversify my portfolio. I'm interested in
          trying out frameworks such as the NET framework, Django and Laravel.
          Also I want to try something other than web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find my bigger projects by scrolling down. And also be sure to
          check out my github
          <a href="https://github.com/KaarleJ?tab=repositories">here</a> where I
          have included also my smaller school projects.

      <section id="project">
        <h2>Hops App</h2>
        <p>
          Hops App is a web application that helps users to plan their
          university studies. The core functionality is a special calendar
          consisting of 4 periods and 2 additional periods for summer studies.
          The user can add courses to the calendar and the application will
          automatically calculate the credits and the workload of that period.
          Courses can also span multiple periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application frontend is built with React, Material UI, and
          TypeScript. Backend is built with TypeScript, NodeJs, ExpressJs,
          Apollo GraphQL, and MongoDB. I also used jest and cypress for unit and
          E2E tests. The app is deployed on fly.io
          <a href="https://hops.fly.dev/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the first fullstack project I've done and it was a great
          learning experience. It was done as part of the Fullstack Open 2022
          studies. I enjoyed building a independent project for the first time
          without too specific instructions. I liked the challenges and solving
          them. For example the extensive use of custom hooks, redux reducers
          and ApolloGQL mutations were a great learning experience. The greatest
          challenge was all the new CSS properties I got to work with and flex
          in particular. But it taught me so much. I've improved a lot since
          then and I'm planning to refactor the project in the future.

        <h2>SimplyFood</h2>
        <p>
          SimplyFood is a recipe website that allows users to create, like,
          search and comment on recipes. This was my second fullstack project
          and it was done as an independent learning project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application is developed with NextJs, which means that the
          frontend and the backend are built with one framework. In addition to
          NextJs, I use TailwindCSS for styling, NextAuth for authentication,
          prismadb as an orm and playwright for e2e tests. I have a simple CI/CD
          pipeline with Github Actions and Vercel's own checks to preview and
          deploy the app. I have different neon.tech Postgres databases for
          production and development and testing. I also use AWS S3 for storing
          images. The app is deployed
          <a href="https://simplyfood-kaarlej.vercel.app/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project presented numerous challenges, each of which provided me
          with valuable learning opportunities. I acquired new testing
          techniques and gained experience in utilizing various cloud resources.
          It was during this project that I first encountered Server Side
          Rendering (SSR) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Furthermore, the
          migration of the app to utilize the NextJs 13 app router and other
          features significantly broadened my knowledge and skills in NextJs.

        <h2>ToDo-App</h2>
        <p>
          ToDo-App is a simple web application that allows users to create, edit
          and delete their todos. The frontend was built with React and the
          backend was built with Spring Boot. The app is deployed
          <a href="https://springtodoapp.fly.dev/">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects goal was to get to know the Spring Boot framework. It was
          a great learning experience and I got to know the framework quite
          well. It was a challenge since lots of my experience comes from the
          NodeJS ecosystem, but also it was a pleasure also because Spring Boot
          does a lot of things for the developer. Definitely a great experience.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          In the dynamic realm of IT, I recognize that programming languages
          represent just a fraction of the skillset. What truly matters is a
          robust grasp of fundamentals and the ability to swiftly adapt to new
          challenges. I harbor a genuine enthusiasm for continuous learning and
          possess the courage to venture into uncharted territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the technologies and concepts I've worked with during
          my studies and freetime: JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJs, ReactJs,
          NextJs, Python, Java, Spring Boot, Quarkus, C, HTML, CSS, SQL, MongoDB,
          PostgreSQL, SQLite, Apollo GraphQL, Prisma, Git, Docker, AWS, CI/CD,
          Jest, Cypress, OOP, Agile, Scrum, Computer Architecture, Sockets and
          more.
