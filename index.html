        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          So who am I? I'm a 22-year-old IT student hailing from Finland,
          currently on my second year of Information Technology studies at the
          University of Turku. Basically I'm a third year student. Having
          wrapped up my Bachelor's thesis, I'm expecting to get my Bachelor's
          degree in the summer of 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fascination with computers and technology dates back to my
          childhood, and I've nurtured programming as a hobby for several years.
          Both in my free time and throughout my academic journey, I've had the
          opportunity to delve into a diverse array of technologies and
          concepts. I have worked with languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript,
          Python, Java, C, and C++, my expertise predominantly lies within the
          JavaScript ecosystem, where I've honed my skills with TypeScript,
          NodeJs, ReactJs, and NextJs. And I am aiming to expand my knowledge
          further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my knowledge stems from my university studies and personal
          projects during my free time. My university studies have provided me
          with a robust foundation in IT and software development. In addition
          to my formal education, I successfully completed the Fullstack Open
          program, where I gained extensive insights into full-stack development
          and application development in general.
        </p>

      <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I've successfully undertaken a couple of independent learning projects
          and am actively engaged in a few more. In addition to these larger
          endeavors, I've tackled several mini and learning projects as integral
          components of my university studies, broadening my skill set along the
          way. Most of my projects are crafted within the NodeJs environment,
          reflecting my proficiency in this ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I'm eager to diversify my portfolio. I'm planning a
          Java desktop project to showcase my object-oriented programming (OOP)
          skills. Additionally, I'm considering delving into Python or Laravel
          for upcoming projects to expand my expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find my bigger projects by scrolling down. And also be sure to
          check out my github
          <a href="https://github.com/KaarleJ?tab=repositories">here</a> where I
          have included also my smaller school projects.

        <h2>Hops App</h2>
        <p>
          Hops App is a web application that helps users to plan their
          university studies. The core functionality is a special calendar
          consisting of 4 periods and 2 additional periods for summer studies.
          The user can add courses to the calendar and the application will
          automatically calculate the credits and the workload of that period.
          Courses can also span multiple periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application frontend is built with React, Material UI, and
          TypeScript. Backend is built with TypeScript, NodeJs, ExpressJs,
          Apollo GraphQL, and MongoDB. I also used jest and cypress for unit and
          E2E tests. The app is deployed on fly.io
          <a href="https://hops.fly.dev/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the first fullstack project I've done and it was a great
          learning experience. It was done as part of the Fullstack Open 2022
          studies. I enjoyed building a independent project for the first time
          without too specific instructions. I liked the challenges and solving
          them. For example the extensive use of custom hooks, redux reducers
          and ApolloGQL mutations were a great learning experience. The greatest
          challenge was all the new CSS properties I got to work with and flex
          in particular. But it taught me so much. I've improved a lot since
          then and I'm planning to refactor the project in the future.

        <h2>SimplyFood</h2>
        <p>
          SimplyFood is a recipe website that allows users to create, like,
          search and comment on recipes. This was my second fullstack project
          and it was done as an independent learning project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application is developed with NextJs which means that the frontend
          and backend are in the same project. The frontend is built with React,
          NextJs, and Tailwind CSS. The backend is built with TypeScript,
          NextJs, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I only have unit tests for the backend
          because of some compatibility issues with NextJs, but am planning to
          add E2E tests in the future. I have a simple CI/CD pipeline with
          Github Actions and Vercel's own checks to preview and deploy the app.
          I have different neon.tech Postgres databases for production and
          development and testing. I also use AWS S3 for storing images. The app
          is deployed
          <a href="https://simplyfood-kaarlej.vercel.app/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt a lot during this project. I got my first touch with SSR and
          SEO when developing this app. It's still a bit WIP and I'm planning to
          add more features to it. I had some challenges planning the jest unit
          tests and configuring Cypress E2E tests to work with NextJs and all of
          my different environments. But they're on the way. Also Vercel's
          free-tier and the updates to it are restricting me a bit and I have
          had to change some of my SSR code to client-side rendering. But
          currently I'm incrementally migrating the app to use NextJs 13 app
          router, which should fix at least the issues with SSR.

        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <p>
          This project is still in the early stages of development. Currently
          the plan is to build a simple todo app. The frontend will be built
          with react and for the backend I will be using Java and Spring Boot
          for the first time. The goal of this project is to get myself
          acquainted with Spring Boot.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          In the dynamic realm of IT, I recognize that programming languages
          represent just a fraction of the skillset. What truly matters is a
          robust grasp of fundamentals and the ability to swiftly adapt to new
          challenges. I harbor a genuine enthusiasm for continuous learning and
          possess the courage to venture into uncharted territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the technologies and concepts I've worked with during
          my studies and freetime: JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJs, ReactJs,
          NextJs, Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
          SQLite, GraphQL, Apollo, Prisma, Git, Docker, AWS, CI/CD, Jest,
          Cypress, OOP, Agile, Scrum, Computer Architecture, Sockets and more.
