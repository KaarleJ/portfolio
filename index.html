        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          So who am I? I'm a 22-year-old IT student hailing from Finland,
          currently on my second year of Information Technology studies at the
          University of Turku. Having wrapped up my Bachelor's thesis, I'm
          expecting to get my Bachelor's degree in the summer of 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fascination with computers and technology dates back to my
          childhood, and I've nurtured programming as a hobby for several years.
          Both in my free time and throughout my academic journey, I've had the
          opportunity to delve into a diverse array of technologies and
          concepts. I have worked with languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript,
          Python, Java, C, and C++, my expertise predominantly lies within the
          JavaScript ecosystem, where I've honed my skills with TypeScript,
          NodeJs, ReactJs, and NextJs. And I am aiming to expand my knowledge
          further.
        </p>

      <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I've successfully undertaken a couple of significant projects and am
          actively engaged in a few more. In addition to these larger endeavors,
          I've tackled several mini and learning projects as integral components
          of my university studies, broadening my skill set along the way. All
          my projects are crafted within the NodeJs environment, reflecting my
          proficiency in this ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I'm eager to diversify my portfolio. I'm planning a
          Java desktop project to showcase my object-oriented programming (OOP)
          skills. Additionally, I'm considering delving into Python or Laravel
          for upcoming projects to expand my expertise.
        </p>

        <h2>Hops App</h2>
        <p>
          Hops App is a web application that helps users to plan their
          university studies. The core functionality is a special calendar
          consisting of 4 periods and 2 additional periods for summer studies.
          The user can add courses to the calendar and the application will
          automatically calculate the credits and the workload of that period.
          Courses can also span multiple periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application frontend is built with React, Material UI, and
          TypeScript. Backend is built with TypeScript, NodeJs, ExpressJs,
          Apollo GraphQL, and MongoDB. I also used jest and cypress for unit and
          E2E tests. The app is deployed on fly.io
          <a href="https://hopsapp.fly.dev/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the first fullstack project I've done and it was a great
          learning experience. It was done as part of the Fullstack Open 2022
          studies. The greatest challenge was all the new CSS properties I got
          to work with and flex in particular. But it taught me so much. I've
          improved a lot since then and I'm planning to refactor the project in
          the future.

        <h2>SimplyFood</h2>
        <p>
          SimplyFood is a recipe website that allows users to create, like,
          search and comment on recipes. This was my second fullstack project
          and it was done as an independent learning project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application is developed with NextJs which means that the frontend
          and backend are in the same project. The frontend is built with React,
          NextJs, and Tailwind CSS. The backend is built with TypeScript,
          NextJs, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I only have unit tests for the backend
          because of some issues with NextJs, but am planning to add E2E tests
          in the future. I have a simple CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions and
          Vercel's own checks to preview and deploy the app. I have different
          neon.tech Postgres databases for production and development and
          testing. I also use AWS S3 for storing images.

        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt a lot during this project. I got my first touch with SSR and
          SEO when developing this app. It's still a bit WIP and I'm planning to
          add more features to it. The greatest challenge was that I had quite a
          long break from this project due to studies and other projects. But it
          was a great learning experience.

        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <p>
          This project is still in the brainstorming phase. But I'm most likely
          going to do a Java desktop project to showcase my OOP skills. One idea
          is a simple chess game. I'm considering JavaFx for the GUI and maybe
          some low level sockets and object serialization for the multiplayer.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          In the dynamic realm of IT, I recognize that programming languages
          represent just a fraction of the skillset. What truly matters is a
          robust grasp of fundamentals and the ability to swiftly adapt to new
          challenges. I harbor a genuine enthusiasm for continuous learning and
          possess the courage to venture into uncharted territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the technologies and concepts I've worked with during
          my studies and freetime: JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJs, ReactJs,
          NextJs, Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
          SQLite, GraphQL, Apollo, Prisma, Git, Docker, AWS, CI/CD, Jest,
          Cypress, OOP, Agile, Scrum, Computer Architecture, Sockets and more.
